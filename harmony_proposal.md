# Valorem Options - Flexible derivatives DeFi Primitive for Harmony Blockchain

## Name of Project

Valorem Options V1

## Project Developer

[Alcibiades Capital LLC](https://alcibiades.capital/about/)

## Proposal Overview

Valorem Options V1 is a DeFi money lego enabling writing covered call and covered put, physically settled, american or 
european options. All written options are fully collateralized against an ERC-20 underlying asset and exercised with an 
ERC-20 exercise asset using a chainlink VRF random number per unique option type for fair settlement. Options contracts 
are issued as fungible ERC-1155 tokens, with each token representing a contract. Option writers are additionally issued 
an ERC-1155 NFT representing a lot of contracts written for claiming collateral and exercise assignment. This design 
eliminates the need for market price oracles, and allows for permission-less writing, and gas efficient transfer, of
a broad swath of traditional options.

### Benefit to the Harmony Ecosystem

This powerful financial primitive will enable structured products, capital efficient money markets, token price 
discovery, and more on the Harmony Blockchain.

### Why on Harmony?

Harmony's low-fee, next generation L1 is an ideal place for new financial derivatives. Harmony's equity-free grant 
program enables the development of next generation MVPs for financial derivatives.

### Partnerships

Alcibiades Capital LLC will be working with the following partners to ensure the rapid implementation of this MVP:

[EOI Digital](https://transform.eoi.digital/) - Risk Modeling, Financial Analysis, Frontend
[Cult Method](https://cultmethod.com/) - Branding, UI, Design
[Alcibiades Capital LLC](https://alcibiades.capital/consulting/) - Smart Contracts, Backend, Security Testing
Harmony - Grant funding, blockchain

## Proposal Ask

## Metrics for Success

This funding will be used to build a testnet MVP of this protocol, at which point Alcibiades Capital LLC will solicit a 
seed round and equity investment to fund a tier 1 audit and production launch, as well as development of roadmap items
such as an off-chain order book, liquidity incentives, day 2 use cases.

Success will be a testnet launch of the protocol described in the abstract, along with a frontend and documentation.

 yet.

## How I met Harmony

At ETH Denver, I (Alcibiades, AKA "Al") had the pleasure of meeting Adrian Robison and other awesome folks from 
Harmony at various events. My interactions made it clear that Harmony would be a great partner with which to launch 
this new project.
